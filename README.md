# Project Overview
Medical Cost is a project that explores the factors that affect personal medical cost (dataset sourced from Kaggle). The dataset provided an opportunity to uncover patterns and trends in medical cost. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, geospatial analysis, clustering, linear regression, and visualization using tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and Python libraries.

#Highlights
● Thorough Data Cleaning: I meticulously clean and validate the dataset, ensuring data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.

● Exploratory Data Analysis: Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and exploratory questions, I uncovered insights into medical charges patterns, BMI, and age trends.

● Clustering Analysis: I segmented indivuals into distinct groups based on age and health patterns, enabling targeted strategies and optimization.

● Linear Regression Analysis: I examined the relationship between medical charges and BMI, providing insights and potential patterns.

● Tableau Analysis: Through interactive visualizations, I compared charges and BMI. I identified patterns and offered recommendations.

# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:

●  Project Management: Project Brief

●  Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
